# Customer_Conversion_Prediction_DS_Project
This is my IITM_DS Final project. The objective is to predict customer conversion for an insurance company.

# Problem Statement
You are working for a new-age insurance company and employ multiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to your customers.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people however they incur a lot of cost.
Hence, it is important to identify the customers that are most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.
We are given the historical marketing data of the insurance company and are required to build a ML model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance.
